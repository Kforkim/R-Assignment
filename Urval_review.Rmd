# R assignment Review from Urval Patel

## Data Inspection

-   data inspection code was flawless, did not encounter any issue with it

## Data Processing

-   It just an suggestion that when write a new file such as "maize_dec4.txt", you can get rid of the commas by adding quote= FALSE
  * Such as : write.table(<Arguments>, <desire file name/format>, sep = "\t", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)
  * This should remove qoutes from the final files.
  * Also good job with using loop : I might try for my self(instead of writing long repeating code)

## Data visualization
* Has no issue at all. Other than that I think you are pretty much done
